**BADGER** is a general binding affinity guidance framework for diffusion models in structure-based drug discovery (SBDD). It introduces two complementary strategies:

- **Classifier Guidance:** Gradient-based plug-and-play guidance using a pretrained binding affinity classifier.
- **Classifier-Free Guidance:** Guidance integrated directly into the diffusion model's training, removing the need for external classifiers.

These methods enable general binding affinity-guided molecular design using diffusion models.

> This code builds heavily on [TargetDiff](https://github.com/guanjq/targetdiff) and [DecompDiff](https://github.com/bytedance/DecompDiff). We thank the authors for their contributions.
