**BADGER** is a general binding affinity guidance framework for diffusion models in structure-based drug discovery (SBDD). It introduces two complementary strategies:

- **Classifier Guidance:** Gradient-based plug-and-play guidance using a pretrained binding affinity classifier.
- **Classifier-Free Guidance:** Guidance integrated directly into the diffusion model's training, removing the need for external classifiers.

These methods enable general binding affinity-guided molecular design using diffusion models.

> This code builds heavily on [TargetDiff](https://github.com/guanjq/targetdiff) and [DecompDiff](https://github.com/bytedance/DecompDiff). We thank the authors for their contributions.

## üöÄ Usage

### Classifier Guidance (on TargetDiff)

#### 1. Train a Binding Affinity Classifier

```bash
python scripts/train_classifier.py configs/training_EGTF.yml
```

#### 2. Sample with Classifier Guidance (on TargetDiff)

```bash
python scripts/sample_diffusion.py configs/sampling.yml -si {user_responsibility: start_id} -ei {user_responsibility: end_id}
```
##### note: {start_id} & {end_id} range from 0-99

#### 3. Sample with Multi-Constraints Classifier Guidance (on TargetDiff)

```bash
python scripts/sample_diffusion_multi.py configs/sampling_multi.yml
```

---

### Classifier-Free Guidance (on TargetDiff)

#### 1. Train a Conditional Diffusion Model

```bash
python scripts/train_diffusion_clsf_free.py configs/training_clsf_free.yml --wandb True
```

#### 2. Sample with Classifier-Free Guidance (on TargetDiff)

```bash
python scripts/sample_diffusion_clsf_free.py configs/sample_clsf_free.yml -si {user_responsibility: start_id} -ei {user_responsibility: end_id} \
  --result_path {user_responsibility: path_to_result_folder}
```
##### note: {start_id} & {end_id} range from 0-99
